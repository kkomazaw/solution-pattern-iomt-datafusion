=== Solution diagrams

The diagram shows how data flows from the edge battlefield sensors through the Fog and local clouds, where transfer learning and Red Hat AI provide adaptive intelligence. This refined intelligence is securely integrated with headquarters (private cloud) and optionally connected to public cloud services. The red area highlights the core scope of the proposal, focusing on AI adaptation and secure deployment in the Fog and local cloud layers.

==== Explanation of the Figure

. Edge (Battlefront)

* Sensors and operating systems at the edge generate real-time incoming data.

* AI models deployed here enable frontline analysis and rapid situational awareness.

. Fog / Local Cloud (Battlefront & Garrison/Base)

* The middle layer manages transfer learning and adapts AI models based on field data.

* Feedback loops send training data from the edge into this layer to refine models.

* Updated models are then redeployed back to the edge.

* This red-highlighted section (Red Hat AI) indicates the scope of the proposed solution, focusing on model utilization, transfer learning, and secure deployment.

. Private Cloud (Headquarters)

* Handles confidential information, in-depth analysis, and model development.

* Provides validated AI models that are pushed back into the Fog/Edge layers.

. Public Cloud (Open domain)

* Used for broader information gathering, analysis, and public services.

* Supports multi-domain data sharing while remaining air-gapped from secure environments.
